# Social Network for Developers

This is a fairly basic webapp using MERN(Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack. After cloning the repository you can run npm install in the root directory as well as the client directory. The client directory contains the React app and has its own dependencies.

* To run the application on the local machine use "npm run dev". The webpage should load on localhost:3000.
* I have used www.mlab.com for mongodb support.


*This application was developed as part of a fullstack(MERN) course on Udemy*
